# My Projects

A list of my projects, some are open source, some are not.

- [jav-play](https://github.com/aizhimou/jav-play): A browser extension that allows users to call the local player to play the movie directly on the movie details page of javdb.com (NSFW)

- [jav-play-go](https://github.com/aizhimou/jav-play-go): A mobile browser userscript that allows users to jump directly from the javdb.com (NSFW) to the missav.ws (NSFW) movie details page, and play it directly without ads.

- [mteam-download](https://github.com/aizhimou/mteam-download): A clodflare worker program that searches for relevant resources in M-Team based on keywords and automatically downloads them to qBittorrent.
