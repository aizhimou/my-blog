# About Me

Hi there!

Back in 2017, I earned my Bachelor’s degree in Management in China — but along the way, I realized I had a stronger passion for tech. I loved the feeling of solving problems and building new things with code. So I followed that passion, taught myself programming, and made a career shift into software development.

For six years, I worked as an enterprise software engineer in China, gaining hands-on experience and sharpening my problem-solving skills. In 2025, I moved to New Zealand and am currently studying at AUT (Auckland University of Technology), pursuing a Graduate Diploma in Computer and Information Sciences. I’m hoping this deeper dive into computer science will help me better understand and explore the world of IT.

Outside of tech, I love cooking and enjoy diving into topics like philosophy, psychology, politics, and economics — basically, anything that helps me make sense of the world.

Feel free to connect with me through social media or email — I’m always up for a good chat, on any topic. I also happen to be on the lookout for job opportunities. If you know of any roles in Auckland (or remote positions from anywhere in the world), I’d truly appreciate a recommendation.

Thanks for stopping by!

2017年，我在中国获得了管理学学士学位。不过我逐渐发现，自己更热爱信息技术，尤其喜欢用技术解决问题、创造新事物的过程。于是，我凭兴趣自学编程，并转行成为一名软件开发工程师。在中国的六年里，我专注于企业软件开发，积累了丰富的实践经验和解决问题的能力。

2025年，我决定来到新西兰生活。目前我在奥克兰理工大学（AUT）攻读计算机与信息科学研究生文凭（Graduate Diploma in Computer and Information Sciences），希望通过系统学习，进一步拓宽对计算机科学的理解和视野。

技术之外，我喜欢做饭，也喜欢思考哲学、心理学、政治、经济等各种话题，正在努力建立自己对世界的理解。

如果你愿意，欢迎通过社交网络或邮件和我随便聊聊，任何话题都可以，我很乐意结交新朋友。同时，我也在积极寻找工作机会。如果你正好了解奥克兰的本地岗位，或者其他地区的远程工作机会，欢迎推荐给我，我会非常感激！
