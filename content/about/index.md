# About Me

In 2017, I earned my bachelor's degree in China. However, during my undergraduate studies, I discovered that my true passion wasn't in my major, but in the world of IT. I loved experimenting with different software and operating systems, and I was especially drawn to the process of using technology to solve problems and create new things.

Driven by this passion, I taught myself to code and successfully transitioned into a career as a Software Development Engineer after graduation. For the next seven years, I focused on enterprise software development within the Java ecosystem, gaining extensive practical experience, strong problem-solving skills, and the trust of many clients.

In 2025, I decided to begin a new chapter in New Zealand. I am currently pursuing a Graduate Diploma in Computer and Information Sciences at Auckland University of Technology (AUT). Through this systematic study, I hope to further broaden my perspective and deepen my understanding of computer science.

Beyond technology, I enjoy cooking and contemplating a wide range of topics, including philosophy, psychology, politics, and economics, as I continuously seek to build my own understanding of the world.

I'm always open to connecting with new people. Please feel free to reach out via social media or email to chat about anything at all—I'd be delighted to make new friends.

On a professional note, I am actively seeking new opportunities. If you know of any local roles in Auckland or remote positions elsewhere, I would be incredibly grateful for a referral!



Thanks for stopping by!

2017 年，我在中国取得本科学位。不过在本科期间我逐渐发现，相比于自己的专业我更热爱 IT 技术，喜欢尝试折腾各种软件和操作系统，尤其喜欢用技术解决问题、创造新事物的过程。于是，我凭兴趣自学编程，毕业后成功转行成为一名软件开发工程师。在中国工作的七年里，我专注于 Java 生态的企业软件开发，积累了丰富的实践经验和解决问题的能力，也得到了许多客户的认可。

2025年，我决定来到新西兰生活。目前我在奥克兰理工大学（AUT）攻读计算机与信息科学研究生文凭（Graduate Diploma in Computer and Information Sciences），希望通过系统学习，进一步拓宽对计算机科学的理解和视野。

技术之外，我喜欢做饭，也喜欢思考哲学、心理学、政治、经济等各种话题，正在努力建立自己对世界的理解。

如果你愿意，欢迎通过社交网络或邮件和我随便聊聊，任何话题都可以，我很乐意结交新朋友。

同时，我也在积极寻找工作机会。如果你正好了解奥克兰的本地岗位，或者其他地区的远程工作机会，欢迎推荐给我，我会非常感激！
